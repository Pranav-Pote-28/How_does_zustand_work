whats a State Management ?
    State management is a way to keep track of and update data (state) in an application, especially when multiple parts of the app need to share the same data.

Why do we need it?
    In a React app, each component has its own state. But when different components need to share and update the same data, managing it can become messy. State management helps keep everything in sync.

Example without state management:
    Imagine a shopping cart in an e-commerce app. If you add an item, both the cart icon (in the navbar) and the cart page should update. Without proper state management, keeping them in sync can be difficult.

Example with state management:
    A global store (like Zustand, Redux, or React Context) keeps the cart data in one place. Whenever the cart updates, all components using that data update automatically.

whats Zustand ?
    Zustand is a simple and lightweight state management library for React. It helps manage global state (data that multiple components need to share) without the complexity of other tools like Redux.

Initial setup :

npx create-react-app zustand_tutorial
cd zustand_tutorial
npm run

whats a store ?
    Think of a store as a global storage room for your app’s data, where multiple components can get or update shared information without passing props around.

whats set in create((set)=>({ states....})) ?
    Yes, the set in (set) => {} is a parameter in the function passed to Zustand’s create() method.

    set is a function provided by Zustand that allows you to update the store’s state.
    It works similarly to React’s setState(), but for a global store.

    ✅ set is provided by Zustand and is used to update state.
    ✅ It merges new state changes into the store.
    ✅ Works similarly to setState but for global state.

So Yes, courseStore is like a Big Function!
    ✔ It holds the state (courses: []).
    ✔ It has actions (addCourse modifies the state).
    ✔ Zustand wraps all of this inside create() and gives us a hook to use anywhere in our React app.

Yes! courseStore is a custom hook that Zustand creates for you.CourseStore has a set of states and actions to use from , like below

courses: [] --> state
addCourses: ()=>{  --> action
    set( ()=>{} ) 
}

=========================================

devtools and persist are zustand ,middlewares

✅ devtools → Helps you see and debug Zustand state using Redux DevTools.
✅ persist → Saves Zustand state in local storage, so data doesn’t reset after a page refresh.

1️⃣ Without persist: You add a course → Refresh page → Course is gone ❌
2️⃣ With persist: You add a course → Refresh page → Course is still there ✅

to check goto inspect -> application -> local Storage ...

=========================================

destructuring: 
    const { addCourse } = useCourseStore();	
    (Subscribes to the whole store)
    re renders the whole state as it tracks all states insie the useCourseStore hook

selector function:
    const addCourse = useCourseStore((state) => state.addCourse);
    (Subscribes only to addCourse)	
    tracks only the addCourse and is efficient 

============================================

const {courses, removeCourse, togglecourseStatus} = useCoursestore(
    (state)=>(
        {courses: state.courses, removeCourse: state.removeCourse, togglecourseStatus: state.togglecourseStatus }
    )
);

Here’s the magic 🪄:
1️⃣ We don’t need the entire store, just courses, removeCourse, and togglecourseStatus.
2️⃣ The callback (state) => ({ ... }) picks only these specific values from the store.
3️⃣ This helps in performance optimization because only these values will trigger re-renders (instead of the whole store).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What happens if we don’t pass a callback?
❌ If you do this:

const { courses, removeCourse, togglecourseStatus } = useCoursestore();

⚠️ It won’t work because useCoursestore() returns the entire store, not just { courses, removeCourse, togglecourseStatus }.
⚠️ Issue: This grabs the entire store and destructures it.
👉 But the problem is, Zustand won't know which values to track, leading to unnecessary re-renders.x    

You would have to manually extract them like this:

const store = useCoursestore();
const courses = store.courses;
const removeCourse = store.removeCourse;
const togglecourseStatus = store.togglecourseStatus;


Which is messy and inefficient. 😵‍💫

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1️⃣ We pass a callback function to useCoursestore().
2️⃣ We destructure the returned object
🔹 Now, courses, removeCourse, and togglecourseStatus are available as separate variables.
